## Reporting Issues

Before opening a new issue:

2. If not, open a new issue with a clear title and detailed reproduction steps

For bug reports, include:
- CaptionFab version
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior

For feature requests, describe the use case and why it would be valuable.

- Follow the official Rust style guidelines
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` to check for issues
- Public APIs require doc comments
